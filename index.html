                  Selwyn Goldberg is a partner in Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati's technology transactions practice and a member of the firm's Policy Committee. Although his primary focus is on technology mergers and acquisitions, his practice includes a wide range of intellectual property-related matters, including licensing, joint ventures, and technology transfers, mainly focused in the areas of computer hardware and software, multimedia, telecommunications, and electronics. Selwyn also regularly represents companies in complex transactions in the area of renewable energy, especially in the solar industry. Transactions in this area range from joint ventures to technology development and supply agreements. Selwyn advises clients on general intellectual property matters, including the development of patent programs; analysis of patent portfolios; development and protection of intellectual property; and valuation issues. Selwyn's clients range from small start-up ventures to Fortune 100 companies.

                <p>
                  In 1958, Berger published his first novel, A Painter of Our Time, which tells the story of the disappearance of Janos Lavin, a fictional exiled Hungarian painter, and his diary's discovery by an art critic friend called John. The book's political currency and detailed description of an artist's working process led to some readers mistaking it for a true story. After being available for a month, the work was withdrawn by the publisher, under pressure from the Congress for Cultural Freedom.[4] The novels immediately succeeding A Painter of Our Time were The Foot of Clive and Corker's Freedom; both presented an urban English life of alienation and melancholy. Berger moved to France in 1962 due to his distaste for life in Britain.
